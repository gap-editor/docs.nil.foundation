## Submit a request

A request order has additional details, such as who requests the proof and what they are willing to pay for it.

The proof requester can create an order like this:

```bash
python3 scripts/request_tools.py push \
    --cost <cost of the request> \
    --file <json file with public_input> \
    --key <key of the statement>
```

## Check order status

Proof requesters can check their requests with the following command:

```bash
python3 scripts/request_tools.py get --key <key of the request>
```

## Obtain the proof

The proof requester can get their proof either by request key or proof key:

```bash
python3 scripts/proof_tools.py get --request_key <key of the request>
```
